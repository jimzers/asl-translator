Real time hand and finger tracking of video feed in order to teach music. Built on top of Agora RTC and [handtrack.js](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/). Custom models built and trained using AWS ML tools.

## FAQ

### Why is the repository called 'asl-translate'?
Last minute pivot of an earlier project

### What instruments are currently supported?
As of writing, we are still nailing down finger and hand tracking into a stable enough state before we build instrumental models. However our first target instrument is the piano.
