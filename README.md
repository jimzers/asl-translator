## FAQ

### Why is the repository called 'asl-translator'?
Last minute pivot of an earlier project

### What instruments are currently supported?
As of writing, we are still nailing down finger, gesture, and hand tracking into a stable enough build before we build instrumental models. However our first target instrument is the piano.
